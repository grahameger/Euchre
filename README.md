# Euchre
REST API for a Euchre Game. Written in C++

**Project Goals**
 - Write a complete multiplayer web game backend using C++ from the ground up, only using the STL, no libraries.
 - Write a complete multiplayer web game frontend using Vanilla JS. No libraries.
 - Clean, reusable code.
 - Speed, lots of concurrent games going on at once

**Learning Goals**
 - Write an HTTP server in C++ using only the STL.
 - Write a JSON parser in C++ using only the STL
 -  Write a performant and asynchronous multiplayer web game in C++
 - Get practice writing a project with *a lot going on*. Most school projects at the University of Michigan have a lot of *depth* but not so much *breadth*. 

**What this is not**
 - Secure. I wouldn't run it on a publicly accessible server.

Currently working on Game Logic.
